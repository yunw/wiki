	__s32 value;
};
}}}

* 'time' is the timestamp, it returns the time at which the event happened.

* type is for example EV_REL for relative moment, EV_KEY for a keypress or
release. More types are defined in include/linux/input.h.
 
* 'code' is event code, for example REL_X or KEY_BACKSPACE, again a complete
list is in include/linux/input.h.
  
* 'value' is the value the event carries. Either a relative change for
EV_REL, absolute new value for EV_ABS (joysticks ...), or 0 for EV_KEY for
release, 1 for keypress and 2 for autorepeat.
